These are my Bash configuration files. I use them on Trisquel Linux and Mac OS X,
but I see no reason why they would not work on other Unix-like systems.

Code is best viewed in a monospace font with line width set to 80 characters
and tab stops set to 4 spaces.

I hope you find my code useful and educational!
